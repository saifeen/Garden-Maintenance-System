Busy schedules often hold people back from caring for their plants and Garden Maintenance System aims to solve that problem by not only providing customised solutions based on region but also periodic sms reminders for wateering their plants. For now featuring only the login page, the project is also planned to feature a 'KNOW ANY PLANT' page and the best tutorial videos on garden and plant care.
